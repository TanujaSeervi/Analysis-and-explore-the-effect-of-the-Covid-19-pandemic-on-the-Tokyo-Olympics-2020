# Introduction:

The Tokyo Summer Olympics 2020 was postponed by a year due to the pandemic and was later held from 23 July to 8 August 2021 in Tokyo, Japan. It was organised behind closed doors with no spectators to avoid the risk of any outbreaks. 206 countries participated in a total of 339 events in 33 sports and 93 countries won medals.
However, the Covid-19 pandemic has impacted all the different nations to different degrees. Some countries were severely impacted, whereas some countries managed to control the damage with some success. Training and mental health of the participating athletes were also impacted.


# Objective: 
The goal of this project to analysis and explore the effect of the Covid-19 pandemic on the Tokyo
Olympics 2020 (held in the year 2021).
Specifically, we want to discover if the performance of the nations (in terms of medals earned) in the Tokyo Olympics had any significant deviation from the last couple of Summer Olympic Games (London Olympics 2012 and Rio Olympics 2016).
